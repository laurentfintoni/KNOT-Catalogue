The KNOT catalog is part of the KNOT pilot, a three-year project (2023-2025) tasked with investigating ways to integrate the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities into the national infrastructure being built by the Central Institute for the Digitization of Cultural Heritage (ICDP) - Digital Library.

Considering the lack of consensus within universities and across them as to what constitutes their digital cultural heritage, KNOT has chosen to focus its investigation on the digital scholarly objects created by academic research within the field of the Humanities, and in particular the Digital Humanities, as an interesting yet unexplored example of existing DCH held by Italian universities. [More information on the pilot and its activities can be found on our website.](https://icdp-digital-library.github.io/KNOT/index.html)

The catalog features research projects and the digital scholarly objects they’ve produced based on a census conducted in the first year of the pilot. The projects and objects are described using the KNOT Data Model, which was developed as a guideline for the description of digital scholarly activity and objects as cultural heritage using a common vocabulary and facilitating the dissemination of good practices.

The catalog is powered by the [CLEF application](https://github.com/polifonia-project/clef), a lightweight, Linked Open Data native cataloguing solution developed as part of the Polifonia H2020 project.
